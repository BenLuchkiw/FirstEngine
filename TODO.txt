This is a list of all #... notes that I left around the code that should be cleaned up or added to.

#Features // device features
#Compute // add compute capabilities
#Resizing // add resizing after swapchain is set up


#TODO // general cleanup

Add a function to check for vulkan error codes and replace all VK_RESULT checks, put in VulkanValidationLayers files







renderer structure:

renderer class
	Only one can exist
	Main interface for rendering

		vkPhysicalDevice(s) // depends on compute
		vkDevice(s) // depends on compute

Window class
	Many can exist
	One for each window

		glfwWindow
		VkSurface
		VkSwapchainKHR
		VkImageView

pipelines and command buffers should be able to be split and shared between windows... maybe Ill see
